- **AI Player**: Uses NEAT to evolve neural networks that control the bird.
- **User Player**: Uses space bar to jump the user controls the bird.
- **User Interface**: Pygame-based UI with smooth graphics and animations.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Pipes spawn randomly, making the game more challenging.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of the score based on pipes passed.
